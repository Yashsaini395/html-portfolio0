<p>Hello! I’m an 18-year-old student passionate about web development. 🌐 As I embark on this <br>exciting journey, I’m eager to learn and grow my skills in creating beautiful and functional <br>websites. Let me share a bit more about myself:</p>

<h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>
<p>Ever since I discovered the magic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve been hooked! The way <br>these languages come together to build interactive and visually appealing websites fascinates me.
    <br> Whether it’s crafting responsive layouts, optimizing performance, or adding that perfect
    <br> animation, I find joy in every line of code.</p>

<h2>What Drives Me</h2>
<p>I believe that the web is a canvas waiting to be painted with creativity. From personal blogs to <br> e-commerce platforms, each project presents a unique challenge, and I thrive on solving them. As <br>
     I explore frameworks like React and dive into backend technologies, I’m excited to contribute <br>my skills to the digital landscape.</p>
